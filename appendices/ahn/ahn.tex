The national Dutch AHN lidar dataset 
\marginnote{\emph{Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland} (AHN)}
\marginnote{\url{https://www.ahn.nl}}
is disseminated in the LAZ format (a compressed LAS, see below) and uses the LAS classification codes. 
Figure~\ref{fig:ahn3} shows all the codes that are used in both AHN3 and AHN4 (they are the same). 
Notice that apart from the pre-defined codes from Table~\ref{tab:las-classes}, it also uses the custom code $26$ for a `civil structure' (Dutch: \emph{kunstwerk}) class that includes special infrastructures such as bridges, statues, and viaducts. 

Notice that in AHN the points representing vegetation are not classified as such, and vegetation is never explicitly classified.
\marginnote{vegetation is classified as $1$/unclassified in AHN3}
The is because the aim of the AHN project is mostly to model dikes and to protect us from floods, and vegetation is not very important for this use-case.
The class $1$ is thus used for vegetation, but other objects such as street furniture (\eg\ lampposts) or cars are also classified as $1$.


% TODO: The standard technically allows for additional user-defined attributes, AHN4 does that actually
