@article{Mucke99,
	Annote = {Definition of point location problem: "Given a set of disjoint geometric objects, determine the objects containing a query point." (p. 63) "Unfortunately, algorithms that are optimal in theory do not necessarily yield to good practical performance. This is also true in the case of point location, mainly because of the necessary preprocessing time and additional storage requirements" The method presented in the paper is efficient in practice (not that much in theory), uses no preprocessing time and no additional storage. Edelsbrunner96 presents an algo faster in theory but probably slower in practice... The algo very good in theory uses preprocessing and/or storage. The algo is only for Delaunay triangulation. For arbitrary triangulation it may go into an infinite loop. see [15]. But this loop can be broken if the other edge (or face) is selected randomly among the possibilities when checking a triangle (tetra). (p. 64) (p. 80) "this procedure is only guaranteed to terminate for Delauany triangulations since they are proven to be 'acyclic for any fixed viewpoint' ". Edelsbrunner90 proves this. Difficult to tell the performance of an algo with Walking; but with the Marching is easier to analyse. Walking : the same algo i'm using; i.e. testing each edge (or face) of a triangle (tetra) and switching to the adjacent one if the test in negative. Till every facet of a simplex returns the same result. Marching : modification of the Walking. "we march towards q by strictly traversing the simplices intersected by a line segment L, starting at a vertex of the initial simplex, and ending in q." Jump-and-march : "we jump to a good starting point via random sampling on the point set. This enhances the overall procedure significantly; in a sense, we are simulating the effects of the bucketing approach by random sampling." Jump : just randomly generating sample points and choosing the closest one. It's like "bucketing". (p. 80) "In terms of the number of tetra visited, jump-and-walk can obviously be only worse than jump-and-march. However, orientation tests in 3d are computationally less involved than intersection tests; and this is particular true, if the implementation emphasizes robustness. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments reveal the jump-and-walk to actually run faster in practice." Very good for my work.... very very good :-) He is not sampling points - probably because he would have to do a point location to identify inside which tetra those points are :^) - but instead samples facets. Then, he tests the query point q with the 3 vertices of each triangles and select the smallest distance; and finally starts the walk from the closest facet. (p. 80) "We chose m = 7n0.25 for the random sample. This was empirically determined to be the best choice with respect to actual CPU time. It is obvious that the larger m, the smaller the number of tetrahedra visited in the walk." (p. 81) procedure of jump-and-march in 3d delaunay triangulation has an expected running time of O(n0.25) for a random distribution. And jump-and-walk performs as good or even better!},

All these features are identified from CONTOUR MAPS only, ie that TIN are not used directly. They show how to create contours from different terrains. Their definitions for the features are characteristics of the contour maps actually. They give good references to people that need to identify the features in a terrain (1st paragraph of the intro). "Classifying terain features in terms of curvature has a problem. If we take a peak and then rotate it about a horizontal axis, it soon stops being a peak, even if curvature, being intrinsic to the shape, does not change. Gravity clearly plays a role, and curvature has nothing to do with it." They use the contour tree, but not 100\% sure if that's exactly the same thing as what van Kreveld used... but seems so yes. It "represents the relationships among contour lines on a contour map."},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter gives guidance on how to prepare elevation data for geomorphometric analysis. It outlines some common errors in raw digital elevation model (DEM) data sources and then suggests approaches for systematically improving the quality of DEMs. It starts with height samples and ends with the final DEMs used for geomorphometric analysis. More precisely, the chapter describes both simple and more advanced algorithms that can be used to reduce systematic and random errors, and enrich the quality of DEMs by incorporating auxiliary information on land cover and the hydrological properties of an area. These algorithms are implemented and described further in the software packages. The nature of DEM-preprocessing algorithms very much depends on the type1 of input data. For this reason, not all algorithms are applicable to raw DEMs. From all the approaches to preprocessing DEMs to reduce errors, three different groups are distinguished: The empirical methods, the filtering methods, and the simulation methods.},

They describe 6 different methods to achieve this.

This guarantees that if at (x,y ) we have both f(x,y ) =h and \Delta f(x,y ) != 0, then in a neighbourhood of (x,y) there will be a genuine contour line running through (x,y), and moreover it will be no less smooth than f, in the sense that the contour line is at least as many times continuously differentiable as f. We shall use this result to show that a continuously differentiable function (C^1) has contour lines with continuously turning tangents, provided the derivative of f is nonzero. Discontinuities of derivative of f correspond to discontinuous changes of direction in the contour line (crossing a V-shaped valley) and discontinuities of f itself correspond to breaks in the contour line (crossing a cliff -edge). The eye is very good at detecting gaps and corners, but very bad at detecting discontinuities in derivatives higher than the rst. For contour lines to be accepted by the eye as a description of a function however smooth, they need to have continuously turning tangents, but higher order continuity of the supposed contours is not needed for them to be visually convincing.

(p. 76) Description of barycentric coordinates when performing triangle- or tetrahedron-based interpolation. It is a form of local coordinates (p.82) "Such area-based coordinates are superior to distance-based coordinates for multivariate data because, when the data are unevenly dense, the coordinates vary anisotropically between two adjacent interpolation points. Distance-based coordinates make no allowance for the distances to the other data; that is, distance-based interpolation is not sensitive to a changing configuration of data" (p. 82) Description of how to fake the insertion-deletion to perform nn interpolation. He argues that computing the nn coord from the Voronoi polygons is a complex procedure because of the variable shape, and number of edges, for each overlapping Voronoi portions. But this is not true: we are working with Delaunay triangulation and every thing is triangle and very easy and efficient to compute area of a triangle (just decompose each Voronoi cell into many triangle since it's a convex polygon it is trivially done). But anyway, the point must still be inserted in the mesh to know which data points are nn of the interpolated point. (p. 75) Local coordinates are a means of defining a given position, or location, relative to nearby reference points without regard for the regional, or geographical, coordinates of the location. (p. 103) Local method: such a restriction is necessary to prevent the masking or submerging of low amplitude surface forms by more dominating features, and prevent widespread propagation of an inadvertent error in some datum.},

	Annote = {Very good paper about space, spatial data models and how to reprensent in a computer. READ AGAIN. "Data modeling is defined as the process of discretizing spatial variation, but may be confused with issues of data structure, and driven by available software rather then by a concern for accurate representation. [...] The purpose of this paper is to examine the issue of spatial data modeling not from the perspective of alternative data structures, but as a process of representing geographical reality." A data model : limited representation of reality, constrained by the finite, discrete nature of computing devices; the term 'discretization' conveys much the same meaning as data model in this context. DATA MODELS OF FIELDS: Piecewise models : constant (Voronoi diagram could be one, as raster); Linear (TIN); Higher order functions (not really useful); Contours; Sampling (just scattered points) VECTORIAL : empty plane littered by objects, which may be points, lines or areas. NETWORKS : for hydrology and transportation apps. (discussion p. 407.) "Data modelling in spatial databases seems to adopt two alternative views, depending on whether it regards reality as occupied by a set of single-valued functions defined everywhere, or by a set of objects. Although the data structures used in the two situations may be identical, they nevertheless represent different perspectives on reality" His point is that neither raster nor vector are accurate to represent geographic entities 'correctly', i.e. they are both ambiguous (vector means contours, TIN, etc...). "The assumption made in this paper is that 'raster' and 'vector' do not provide an adequate and sound basis for a discussion of data modeling." Again, 2 views on space/reality : (1) continuous function everywhere (2) emtpy with objects scattered. "Although the data structures used in the 2 situations may be identical, they nevertheless represent different perspectives on reality." old [Goodchild92-1]},

So he uses USGS DEMs, and creates the TINs from these DEMs, or from contour lines... which is not optimal in my opinion. Nevertheless, his study is useful. ''a model will be judged more efficient than another if it represents a surface more accurately within the same amount of storage space, measured in bytes.'' Therefore, the common belief that TIN is more space-efficient is handicapped by the fact that a TIN must have AT LEAST 3 times less points to be of equal space... which makes sense. Some of his conclusions: 1. TINs made of points sampled from DEMs are inferior to the full DEM. (for the same efficiency that is).},

It has the potential to be a powerful modelling device, but is usually misused, and so becomes a handicap to analysis. There are, however, two possible interpretations of the meaning of the grid: a point (the intersection of grid lines) and an area (the interior of each cell ). The rectangular tessellation of a plane (the pixel ) has a huge potential for analysis, and, as a basis for finite element analysis (Kuniansky and Lowther 1993) and cellular automata (Clarke et al. 1994 ), is so used in wildfire, and air and water pollution modelling.},

Slivers often survive Delaunay-based tetrahedral mesh generation methods because their small circumradii minimize the likelihood of vertices being inserted in their circumspheres. Even if slivers are not removed, Delaunay refinement tetrahedralizations are sometimes adequate for such numerical techniques as the control volume method [66], which operates upon the Voronoi diagram rather than the Delaunay tetrahedralization. The Voronoi dual of a tetrahedralization with bounded circumradius-to-shortest edge ratios has nicely rounded cells, even if slivers are present in the tetrahedralization itself.},
